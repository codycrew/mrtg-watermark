Disclaimer:  Please use these scripts at your own risk.  I am not responsible if your server catches on fire when you try to implement these scripts.


Use these scripts to create watermarked versions of your MRTG graphic images.

I've created a process to take your existing MRTG images and add a watermark that displays the last polled values in numeric form.

See the attached sample images.


Prerequisites:

This guide assumes you already have a working installation of mrtg.

Install imagemagick

apt-get install imagemagick

Please place the watermarking script(s) in a directory such as /root/scripts.
